## Security Features
The following features are available in `matlab-proxy` to provide secure access to MATLAB:
  - [SSL Support](#ssl-support)
  - [Token-Based Authentication](#token-based-authentication)

----

## **SSL Support**

1. *MWI_ENABLE_SSL*

    Use the environment variable `MWI_ENABLE_SSL` to configure SSL/TLS support for `matlab-proxy`. To enable SSL/TLS, set `MWI_ENABLE_SSL` to `True`. By default, this uses a self-signed certificate. To use custom SSL certificates instead, specify these files using the following environment variables when you start `matlab-proxy`.

2. *MWI_SSL_CERT_FILE*
   
    A string with the full path to a single file in PEM format containing the certificate as well as any number of CA certificates needed to establish the certificateâ€™s authenticity.

2. *MWI_SSL_KEY_FILE*
   
   A string with the full path to a file containing the private key. If absent, the private key must be present in the cert file provided using `MWI_SSL_CERT_FILE`.

Example:
```bash
# Start matlab-proxy with SSL enabled
$ env MWI_ENABLE_SSL=True MWI_SSL_CERT_FILE="/path/to/certificate.pem" MWI_SSL_KEY_FILE="/path/to/keyfile.key" matlab-proxy-app

# The access link appears in the terminal at startup:
==================================================================================================
                                       Access MATLAB at:                              
                                    https://127.0.0.1:37109   
==================================================================================================

# NOTE: The server is running HTTP(S) ! 

```

## **Token-Based Authentication**

`matlab-proxy` is a web server and that allows one to start and access MATLAB on the machine the server is running on. Anyone with access to the server can access MATLAB and thereby the machine on which its running.

`Token-Based Authentication` is enabled by default and the server requires a token to authenticate access. Users can provide this token to the server in the following ways:

1. Use the [URL parameter](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.4) : `mwi-auth-token`. Example:
    ```html
    https://localhost:8888/?mwi-auth-token=abcdef...
    ```
    The browser caches the token for subsequent interactions.

2. Use the auth token input field in the Status Information dialogue box that appears when the user is not already logged in.
    <p align="center">
      <img width="800" src="./img/token_authentication_page.png">
    </p>

3. Use a `mwi-auth-token` header. Example:
    ``` html
    mwi-auth-token:abcdef..
    ```
> :warning: `matlab-proxy` version v0.16.0 and later require you to provide the token name in the URL or header with hyphens instead of underscores, for example `mwi-auth-token` instead of `mwi_auth_token`.

**NOTE** : Its highly recommended to use this feature along with SSL enabled as shown [here](#use-token-authentication-with-ssl-enabled).

### **Use auto-generated tokens**

When enabled, `matlab-proxy` requires the URL to specify the access token using the [query component](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.4) `mwi-auth-token`.

Example:

```bash

# Start matlab-proxy with Token-Based Authentication enabled by default
$ matlab-proxy-app

# The access link appears in the terminal:
==================================================================================================
                                  Access MATLAB at:                              
    http://127.0.0.1:37109?mwi-auth-token=SY78vUw5qyf0JTJzGK4mKJlk_exkzL_SMFJyilbGtNI   
==================================================================================================
```
In this example `SY78vUw5qyf0JTJzGK4mKJlk_exkzL_SMFJyilbGtNI` is the token that the server needs for future communication.

After initial access, this token is cached by the browser, and all subsequent access from the same browser to the server will not require this token.
You will however need this token to access the server from a new browser session or if you have cleared cookies or have cookies disabled.

### **Specify your own token**

*Optionally*, you can also specify your own secret token using the environment variable `MWI_AUTH_TOKEN`.
Ensure that your custom token is url safe. 
A token can safely contain any combination of alpha numeric text along with the following permitted characters: `- .  _  ~`

See [URI Specification RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) for more information on URL safe characters.

Example:
```bash

# Start matlab-proxy with Token-Based Authentication enabled, and with custom token with a value of "MyCustomSecretToken"
$ env MWI_ENABLE_TOKEN_AUTH=True MWI_AUTH_TOKEN=MyCustomSecretToken matlab-proxy-app

# The access link appears in the terminal:
==================================================================================================
                                  Access MATLAB at:                              
                http://127.0.0.1:37109?mwi-auth-token=MyCustomSecretToken   
==================================================================================================
```

### **Use Token Authentication with SSL enabled**

It is recommended to enable both `Token-Based Authentication` and `SSL` to secure your access to MATLAB via matlab-proxy. As an example, the following command enables access to MATLAB using HTTPS and token-based authentication

For example, the following command starts the server to deliver content on `HTTPS` along with Token-Based Authentication enabled:
```bash
# Start matlab-proxy with Token-Based Authentication & SSL enabled with custom token with a value of "asdf"
$ env MWI_SSL_CERT_FILE="/path/to/certificate.pem" MWI_SSL_KEY_FILE="/path/to/keyfile.key" MWI_ENABLE_TOKEN_AUTH=True MWI_AUTH_TOKEN=asdf matlab-proxy-app

# The access link appears in the terminal:
==================================================================================================
                                  Access MATLAB at:                              
                        https://127.0.0.1:37109?mwi-auth-token=asdf   
==================================================================================================

# NOTE: This server is running HTTP(S)

```

### **Token Recovery**

To recover tokens for a previously started server, you will need access to either:

1. The machine on which the server was started, while being logged in as the user that started the server.
2. An authenticated browser session started for the same user.

#### **Recover tokens from the machine**

1. Login to the machine on which the servers are running, as the user that started matlab-proxy.
1. Activate the python environment from which the server was started.
    * This should be the same environment from which the server was started.
    * Run the executable `matlab-proxy-app-list-servers`

Example:
```bash

# Connect to the machine on which the server was started:
$ ssh test-user@usermachine 

# Running this command should print all running servers!
(usermachine) $ matlab-proxy-app-list-servers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             Your running servers are:                                             
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  https://127.0.0.1:46525/asdf?mwi-auth-token=asdfasdf
2.  http://127.0.0.1:39057/test?mwi-auth-token=_qNJIXEbnXwrj9nxZwbJiWno0YqYSh8BMdQOR6K67y0
3.  http://127.0.0.1:35647/test?mwi-auth-token=r6djdrcf591PttYlDZcVL78xIa1XgCviM9dQD-BrqDE
4.  http://127.0.0.1:36537/test?mwi-auth-token=HdQ-9tooAzA0A0CrpUxP1e5crQBErMQC3tPGTkTtrVo
5.  http://127.0.0.1:35433/test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     Thank you.                                                    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

For servers for which `Token-Based Authentication` were enabled, the URLs above will include their tokens.
You can use them to gain access to your server as described in the [Introduction](#introduction).

#### **Retrieve token from a previously authenticated browser session**

1. Click on the `View Token` link to see the token
    <p align="center">
      <img width="600" src="./img/retrieve_token.png">
    </p>

2. Click on the `Hide Token` link to hide the token 
    <p align="center">
      <img width="600" src="./img/retrieved_token.png">
    </p>

### **How to disable Token-Based Authentication**

Since `Token-Based Authentication` is enabled by default, one can set the environment variable `MWI_ENABLE_TOKEN_AUTH` to `False` on server startup to disable `Token-Based Authentication`.

Example:

```bash

# Start matlab-proxy with Token-Based Authentication disabled
$ env MWI_ENABLE_TOKEN_AUTH="False" matlab-proxy-app

# The access link appears in the terminal:
==================================================================================================
                                       Access MATLAB at:                              
                                    http://127.0.0.1:37110  
==================================================================================================
```

## Security Best Practices

* Never share access to your server
  Never share URLs from `matlab-proxy` with others. Doing so is equivalent to sharing your user account.
  
* System administrators who start `matlab-proxy` for other users, must start the proxy as the user for whom the server is intended.
